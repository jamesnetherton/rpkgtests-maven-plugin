= `repackage-tests-maven-plugin`

This Maven plugin makes it possible to run tests from third party test jars outside their original source tree.

== The problem

Say that a third party project publishes their test-jars on Maven Central and you want to run their tests as a part of
your own build in a fully independent source tree.

You hope to make that possible by adding those test-jars as a dependency in the module where you want to run the included
tests. But you will find our soon that Surefire/Failsafe Maven plugin cannot run those tests seamlessly. The build will
most probably fail due to dependencies missing in the class path of the executed tests. Closer look will reveal that the
missing dependencies are exactly the ones having the test scope in the POM of the test module of the third party
project. This is caused by the fact that Maven, by design, does not (transitively) pull test dependencies for you - see
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MNG-1378

There are several solutions to this problem.

== The "ban test scope" solution

Simply removing `<scope>test</scope>` from all dependencies on the side of the third party project would make your build
work. It is rather unlikely that the third party project will be ready to do this for you.

== The "split tests from the test app" solution

Another solution (on the third party project side) is to put the test classes into `src/main/java` directory of a separate
Maven module. Good luck with asking the third party project to do this for you.

== "Synthetic tests modules" solution

That's what the `repackage-tests-maven-plugin` implements. All necessary steps happen on your side, so you'll be able to
run any third party tests without needing to do anything special on their side. The plugin downloads the test-jars
(specified via the `testJars` mojo parameter) and the associated POMs and does the following modifications with them:

* Renames the module by appending `-tests` to the original artifactId
* Removes all non-`test` dependencies
* Removes the `test` scope from every remaining dependency
* Adds the dependency on the original artifact (without the `-rpkgtests` suffix)

The resulting `pom.xml` files are then installed along with the original test-jars into the local Maven repository. And
your module in which you'd like to run them can seamlessly use them as dependencies.
